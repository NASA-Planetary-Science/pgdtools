# Presolar grain database tools (pgdTools)


This package provides a set of tools to
easily access and interface with the presolar grain database.
This package allows users to manage which database(s) they want to use
and provides a set of tools to filter and access the data itself.
Furthermore, maintainer tools are provided as well
in order for database maintainers to keep the package up to date.

For installation, usage guidance, and more information,
see the [documentation](https://pgdtools.readthedocs.io).

While we hope that most of functionality is stable,
this package is still under development.
Please report any issues you encounter and let us know what you think!
