  abstract = {We report the first tungsten isotopic measurements in stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains recovered from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite. The isotopes 182,183,184,186W and 179,180Hf were measured on both an aggregate (KJB fraction) and single stardust SiC grains (LS+LU fraction) believed to have condensed in the outflows of low-mass carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with close-to-solar metallicity. The SiC aggregate shows small deviations from terrestrial (= solar) composition in the 182W/184W and 183W/184W ratios, with deficits in 182W and 183W with respect to 184W. The 186W/184W ratio, however, shows no apparent deviation from the solar value. Tungsten isotopic measurements in single mainstream stardust SiC grains revealed lower than solar 182W/184W, 183W/184W, and 186W/184W ratios. We have compared the SiC data with theoretical predictions of the evolution of W isotopic ratios in the envelopes of AGB stars. These ratios are affected by the slow neutron-capture process and match the SiC data regarding their 182W/184W, 183W/184W, and 179Hf/180Hf isotopic compositions, although a small adjustment in the s-process production of 183W is needed in order to have a better agreement between the SiC data and model predictions. The models cannot explain the 186W/184W ratios observed in the SiC grains, even when the current 185W neutron-capture cross section is increased by a factor of two. Further study is required to better assess how model uncertainties (e.g., the formation of the 13C neutron source, the mass-loss law, the modeling of the third dredge-up, and the efficiency of the 22Ne neutron source) may affect current s-process predictions.},

Furthermore, we estimate that the majority of the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.}

Using the 16 most-precise measurements, we estimate the relative contributions of stellar nucleosynthesis during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and the initial compositions of the parent stars to the compositions of the grains. To do this, we compare our data to the results of several published stellar models that employ different values for some important parameters. Our analysis confirms that s-process synthesis during the AGB phase only slightly modified the titanium compositions in the envelopes of the stars where mainstream silicon carbide grains formed, as it did for silicon. Our analysis suggests that the parent stars of the {$>$}1 {$\mu$}m silicon carbide grains that we measured were generally somewhat more massive than the Sun (2\textendash 3 M{$\odot$}) and had metallicities similar to or slightly higher than solar. Here we differ slightly from results of previous studies, which indicated masses at the lower end of the range 1.5\textendash 3 M{$\odot$} and metallicities near solar. We also conclude that models using a standard 13C pocket, which produces a good match for the main component of s-process elements in the solar system, overestimate the contribution of the 13C pocket to s-process nucleosynthesis of titanium found in silicon carbide grains. Although previous studies have suggested that the solar system has a significantly different titanium isotopic composition than the parent stars of silicon carbide grains, we find no compelling evidence that the Sun falls off of the array defined by those stars. We also conclude that the Sun does lie on the low-metallicity end of the silicon and titanium arrays defined by mainstream silicon carbide grains.},

Most grains were also examined by Raman spectroscopy. The majority have large isotopic anomalies, with 13C12C and 14N15N up to 30X and 9X solar, and 29,30Si enriched by up to 102\%.. Only two grains, characterized by extremely heavy carbon ({$\delta$}13C = 28,582 and 18,883\%.) give evidence for fossil 26Mg, with (26Al27Al)0 ratios of 2.1 \texttimes{} 10-3 and 3.9 \texttimes{} 10-3. On the basis of C and Si isotopic composition, twenty-nine of the grains fall into three compact clusters, presumably from three discrete sources. Two of these clusters are anomalous and comprise only grains of cubic structure (according to their Raman spectra). The third, isotopically, normal cluster contains only anhedral, noncubic grains; and although contamination cannot be categorically excluded, an origin in a reducing environment in the early solar system is a viable possibility. The reality of these clusters is further supported by differences in morphology, size, N-content, and Al/N. This clustering of coarsegrained ({$>$}6 {$\mu$}m) SiC stands in sharp contrast to the quasicontinuous distribution af finer grained SiC and suggests that the top \textasciitilde{} 0.1\% of the mass distribution is a distinct population. A few conclusions can be reached about the astrophysical origin of the coarse-grained SiC. The C and N isotopic compositions of the anomalous grains are not very diagnostic, being consistent with H-burning in the CNO cycle. The very existence of SiC requires C-rich stars, of C/O {$>$} 1. The Si-isotopic compositions qualitatively show the signature of neutron capture in He-burning shells of highly evolved stars, narrowing the choice to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or Wolf-Rayet stars. AGB stars are the more likely candidates, as only they can (during their final, planetary nebula phase) provide high mass loss rates and hence the high gas densities required for growth of large SiC grains.},

However, two of these residues, from Leoville (CV3) and Qingzhen (EH3), only produced one anomalous SiC grain each. The other meteorites studied included Murchison and six UOCs. The results for Murchison are broadly similar to those found by previous Murchison SiC studies. However, no two Murchison studies are identical, implying that despite the number of grains analyzed to date, we still do not have a representative sample of Murchison SiC. Statistical comparisons between the SiC in Murchison and other meteorites are also hampered by the small sample sizes relative to the range of isotopic compositions observed. Nevertheless, of the six UOCs studied only the results obtained from Inman are clearly different from Murchison. Several previous studies have concluded that most of the SiC formed in AGB stars, although the silicon isotopes remain problematic. However, few, if any, C-rich AGB stars have 12C13C ratios less than 20. Those SiC grains with the isotopically heaviest carbon (12C13C {$<$} 20) may have come from s-process poor J- and R-type carbon stars. Four small groups of grains, which appear to require a minimum of four distinct SiC sources, have been identified in a compilation of 308 individual SiC analyses but the overall lack of groupings in the compilation suggest that either there were a large number of stellar sources or that there were a few sources whose isotopic compositions varied considerably. Simple calculations suggest that one could expect 10 to 100 AGB stars to have contributed SiC to a protosolar system embedded in a mature molecular cloud. Even a few 10s of sources are enough to explain the apparent differences seen in the various studies of Murchison SiC and, with the exception of Inman, the differences observed from meteorite to meteorite. This number of sources would also appear to favor galactic chemical evolution as the explanation of the slope 1.3 array formed by SiC in silicon three isotope plots rather than explanations which appeal to a single star or rare high mass AGB stars.},

  abstract = {Seven hundred and twenty SiC grains from the Murchison CM2 chondrite, ranging in size from 1 to 10 micrometers, were analyzed by ion microprobe mass spectrometry for their C-isotopic compositions. Subsets of the grains were also analyzed for N (450 grains), Si (183 grains), Mg (179 grains), and Ti (28 grains) isotopes. These results are compared with previous measurements on 41 larger SiC grains (up to 15 x 26 micrometers) from a different sample of Murchison analyzed by Virag et al. (1992) and Ireland, Zinner, \& Amari (1991a). All grains of the present study are isotopically anomalous with C-12/C-13 ratios ranging from 0.022 to 28.4 x solar, N-14/N-15 ratios from 0.046 to 30 x solar, Si-29/Si-28 from 0.54 to 1.20 x solar, Si-30/Si-28 from 0.42 to 1.14 x solar, Ti-49/Ti-48 from 0.96 to 1.95 x solar, and Ti-50/Ti-48 from 0.94 to 1.39 x solar. Many grains have large Mg-26 excesses from the decay of Al-26 with inferred Al-26/Al-27 ratios ranging up to 0.61, or 12,200 x the ratio of 5 x 10-5 inferred for the early solar system. Several groups can be distinguished among the SiC grains. Most of the grains have C-13 and N-14 excesses, and their Si isotopic compositions (mostly excesses in Si-29 and Si-30) plot close to a slope 1.34 line on a Delta Si-29/Si-28 versus Delta Si-30/Si-28 three-isotope plot. Grains with small C-12/C-13 ratios (less than 10) tend to have smaller or no N-14 excesses and high Al-26/Al-27 ratios (up to 0.01). Grains with C-12/C-13 greater than 150 fall into two groups: grains X have N-15 excesses and Si-29 and Si-30 deficits and the highest (0.1 to 0.6) Al-26/Al-27 ratios; grains Y have N-14 excesses and plot on a slope 0.35 line on a Si three-isotope plot. In addition, large SiC grains of the Virag et al. (1992) study fall into three-distinct clusters according to their C-, Si-, and Ti-isotopic compositions. The isotopic diversity of the grains and the clustering of their isotopic compositions imply distinct and multiple stellar sources. The C- and N-isotopic compositions of most grains are consistent with H-burning in the CNO cycle. These and s-process Kr, Xe, Ba, and Nd suggest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or Wolf-Rayet stars as likely sources for the grains, but existing models of nucleosynthesis in these stellar sites fail to account in detail for all the observed isotopic compositions. Special problems are posed by grains with C-12/C-13 less than 10 and almost normal and heavy N-isotopic compositions. Also the Si- and Ti-isotopic compositions, with excesses in Si-29 and Si-30 relative to Si-28 and excesses in all Ti isotopes relative to Ti-48, do not precisely conform with the compositions predicted for slow neutron capture. Additional theoretical efforts are needed to achieve an understanding of the isotopic composition of the SiC grains and their stellar sources.},

  abstract = {We report the results of SIMS isotopic analyses of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon made on 849 small ({$\approx$} 1 {$\mu$}m) individual silicon carbide grains from the Murchison meteorite. The isotopic compositions of the major elements carbon and silicon of most grains (mainstream) are similar to those observed in larger grain studies suggesting an AGB star origin of these grains. In contrast, the trace element nitrogen shows a clear dependency on grain size. 14N/15N ratios increase with decreasing grain size, suggesting different stellar sources for grains of different size. Typically observed 14N/15N ratios in the small grains of this study are {$\approx$}2700, clearly larger than the values expected from model calculations of AGB stars. In addition to the three dredge-up episodes characteristic for the evolution of AGB stars, extra-mixing of CNO-processed matter in low-mass AGB stars appears to be a promising possibility in order to explain the high 14N/15N ratios of the small circumstellar SiC grains. A small fraction of grains shows a silicon isotopic signature not observed in larger circumstellar SiC grains from Murchison. Their stellar origin is still uncertain. The minor type A, B, Y, and X grains were found to be present at a level of a percent, which is similar to their abundance in the larger-grain SiC separates from Murchison. Oxygen isotopic compositions are normal within the experimental uncertainties of several 10\%, indicating that oxygen of stellar origin is rare or even absent in the SiC grains. We conclude that most of the oxygen is a contaminant which was introduced into the SiC grains after their formation, e.g., during sample processing in the laboratoy. We identified a nitride grain, most likely Si3N4 with little carbon, with highly anomalous isotopic compositions (12C/13C = 157 {$\pm$} 33, 14N/15N = 18 {$\pm$} 1, {$\delta$}29Si = -43 {$\pm$} 56\textperthousand, {$\delta$}30Si = -271 {$\pm$} 50\textperthousand ). The isotopic patterns of carbon, nitrogen, and silicon resemble those of the rare SiC X grains suggesting that these two rare constituents of circumstellar matter formed in the same type of stellar source, namely, Type II supernovae.},

  abstract = {One hundred and forty individual SiC grains (1\textendash 9.6 {$\mu$}m) and twenty-two grain aggregates (2.3\textendash 7.8 {$\mu$}m) from the Orgueil (CI) chondrite have been measured by ion microprobe. Silicon and carbon isotopic data were obtained for all individual grains and aggregates, and nitrogen, magnesium, and aluminum abundances and isotopic compositions were measured for most grains and aggregates. Abundances of lithium, beryllium, boron, and sodium were measured for some individual grains. Orgueil SiC is remarkably similar to Murchison K-series SiC in the ranges and distributions of silicon and carbon isotopic compositions, the initial abundances of 26Al, the abundances of minor and trace elements, and the proportions of isotopically unusual grains. Higher 15N14N ratios in 1\textendash 4 {$\mu$}m Murchison K-series SiC grains relative to similar-sized Orgueil grains are inferred to be due to higher amounts of terrestrial nitrogen in the Murchison samples. Higher 15N14N ratios in 3\textendash 6 {$\mu$}m Murchison KJH SiC grains cannot be explained by terrestrial nitrogen and imply that larger SiC grains sampled a different population of parent stars. SiC aggregates have different average silicon and carbon compositions than individual grains, indicating different source stars for the 0.1\textendash 1 {$\mu$}m constituent grains. However, the aggregates probably formed by clumping of small grains during laboratory procedures, not at the stellar source. Differences between Murchison L-series SiC and SiC from Murchison K-series and Orgueil are due to the presence of terrestrial SiC among L-series grains and to the larger average grain size of L-series SiC. When terrestrial contamination, sample size, and grain size are taken into account, there is no evidence of an intrinsic difference between Orgueil and Murchison SiC. The Orgueil data provide new information about stellar nucleosynthesis and the SiC parent stars. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions indicate that nuclear processing in addition to that described by most stellar models occurs below the convective stellar envelope during the Red Giant and AGB phases (Cool Bottom Processing). Grains with high 15N14N but with other characteristics consistent with AGB source stars indicate that 15N is produced in AGB stars, contrary to the predictions of the standard models. A significantly higher rate for the 180({$\alpha$}, n)15N reaction than is typically used might reconcile the models with the observations. No data currently rule out a higher reaction rate. Addition of 180 produced via 14N ({$\alpha$}, {$\psi$})180 below the hydrogen shell and burned to 15N in the envelope may also play a role in producing the high 15N14N ratios observed in some SiC grains. Following previous workers, we take the slope {$\sim$}2.2 silicon isotope array defined by mainstream SiC grains to reflect the initial compositions of the parent stars due to galactic evolution. A general correlation between 12C13C and 29,30Si28Si and more scatter around the silicon array at low 29,30Si28Si indicate that SiC grains with higher 29,30Si28Si ratios come from higher-metallicity parent stars. A lack of resolved isotopic effects in 25Mg24Mg suggests that variations in initial magnesium compositions of the parent stars are at least a factor of three smaller than those in silicon and that the 22Ne neutron source was not significantly activated in the AGB stars that produced SiC grains, in accord with theory. These observations indicate that the parent stars of most mainstream SiC grains were {$\leqslant$}2.3 M{$\odot$} and experienced enough Third Dredge-up thermal pulses to supply their envelopes with 2\textendash 3\% helium,shell material. A few grains have characteristics suggesting that they came from more-massive stars. Most parent stars of {$>$} 1 {$\mu$}m SiC grains apparently had metallicities higher than that of the sun.},

The observed isotopic patterns of Mo from mainstream SiC grains clearly reveal the signature of s-process nucleosynthesis. Three-isotope plots of all grain data ({$\delta$}iMo vs. {$\delta$}92Mo) show strong linear correlations with characteristic slopes. This finding suggests mixing of solar-like material and pure s-process material in the parent stars.

Carbon was measured in 41 X grains, n in 37 grains, Mg-Al in 18 grains, Si in 87 grains, Ca-Ti in 25 grains, and Fe in 8 grains. These X grains have 12C/13C ratios between 18 and 6800, 14N/15n ratios from 13 to 200, {$\delta$}29Si/28Si between -750 and +60\%0, {$\delta$}30Si/28Si from -770 to -10\%0, and 54Fe/56Fe ratios that are compatible with solar within the analytical uncertainties of several tens of percent. Many X grains carry large amounts of radiogenic 26Mg (from the radioactive decay of 26Al, half-life {$\cong$} 7 times 105 years) and radiogenic 44Ca (from the radioactive decay of 44Ti, half-life = 60 years). While all X grains but one have radiogenic 26Mg, only {$\sim$}20\% of them have detectable amounts of radiogenic 44Ca. Initial 26Al/27Al ratios of up to 0.36 and initial 44Ti/48Ti ratios of up to 0.56 can be inferred. The isotopic data are compared with those expected from the potential stellar sources of SiC dust. Carbon stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and novae are ruled out as stellar sources of the X grains. The isotopic compositions of C and Fe and abundances of extinct 44Ti are well explained both by type Ia and type II supernova (SN) models. The same holds for 26Al/27Al ratios, except for the highest 26Al/27Al ratios of {$>$}0.2 in some X grains. Silicon agrees qualitatively with SN model predictions, but the observed 29Si/30Si ratios in the X grains are in most cases too high, pointing to deficiencies in the current understanding of the production of Si in SN environments. The measured 14n/15n ratios are lower than those expected from SN mixing models. This problem can be overcome in a 15 Modot; type II SN if rotational mixing, preferential trapping of N, or both from 15n-rich regions in the ejecta are considered. The isotopic characteristics of C, N, Si, and initial 26Al/27Al ratios in small X grains are remarkably similar to those of large X grains (2\textendash 10 {$\mu$}m). Titanium-44 concentrations are generally much higher in smaller grains, indicative of the presence of Ti-bearing subgrains that might have served as condensation nuclei for SiC. The fraction of X grains among presolar SiC is largely independent of grain size. This implies similar grain-size distributions for SiC from carbon stars (mainstream grains) and supernovae (X grains), a surprising conclusion in view of the different conditions for dust formation in these two types of stellar sources.},

We have previously reported that mainstream SiC grains have strong enrichments in the s-process isotopes of Sr, Zr and Mo [2-5] and that X-grains have an unusual Mo isotopic composition that differs from s- and r-process expectations [6,7].

In a Si 3-isotope plot, their Si isotopic compositions plot to the right of the correlation line defined by the majority of presolar SiC grains (the mainstream population), whose isotopic compositions indicate an origin in C-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of near-solar metallicity. Because of their low abundance, the new Y grains were identified by automatic isotopic imaging of the 12C/13C ratio in the ion microprobe. We report C, N, and Si isotopic ratios of all 27 grains, inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratios of 18, and Ti isotopic ratios of 20 grains. Whereas 14N/15N and 26Al/27Al ratios exhibit the same range as mainstream grains, the C, Si, and Ti isotopic ratios are distinct. Carbon-12/carbon-13 ratios range up to 295 and 30Si/28Si excesses up to 183\textperthousand{} relative to solar. The average 29Si/28Si ratio of Y grains is by 59\textperthousand{} smaller than that of mainstream grains. Ti isotopic ratios relative to 48Ti are somewhat similar to those of mainstream grains, but extend to more extreme anomalous compositions. One grain has 46Ti/48Ti, 49Ti/48Ti, and 50Ti/48Ti excesses of 183\textperthousand, 365\textperthousand, and 990\textperthousand, respectively, relative to solar. These features exhibited by Y grains point to an origin in AGB stars of somewhat lower than solar metallicity. In the envelope of such stars the proportion of 12C and s-processed material dredged up from deep zones that experienced partial He burning and was mixed with original material is higher than in stars of solar metallicity. Their envelopes are therefore expected to have larger 12C/13C, 30Si/28Si, and 49Ti/48Ti and 50Ti/48Ti ratios than mainstream grains. We compare the C, Si, and Ti isotopic compositions of Y grains with the results of theoretical models of AGB stars with 1.5, 3, and 5 M{$\Sun$} and Z = 0.006, 0.01, and 0.02. While solar-metallicity (Z = 0.02) AGB models cannot account for the Y grain data, the models with Z = 0.01 can reproduce the measured isotopic compositions reasonably well. A range of stellar masses (from 1.5 M{$\Sun$} possibly up to 5 M{$\Sun$}) is indicated by the grain data. The present study together with additional data on SiC grains of type Z furthermore indicate that the rate of change of the ratios of the secondary Si isotopes (29Si and 30Si) relative to 28Si prior to solar system formation was lower than has been generally assumed, implying larger contributions of 28Si from Type Ia supernovae compared to those from Type II supernovae. The Si isotopic ratios of Galactic cosmic rays also suggest such an evolution.},

These isotopic signatures are theoretically predicted for the ejecta from ONe novae and cannot be matched by any other stellar sources. Previous studies of presolar grains from primitive meteorites have shown that the vast majority formed in red giant outflows and supernova ejecta. Although a classical nova origin was suggested for a few presolar graphite grains on the basis of 22Ne enrichments, this identification is somewhat ambiguous since it is based on only one trace element. Our present study presents the first evidence for nova grains on the basis of major element isotopic compositions of single grains. We also present the results of nucleosynthetic calculations of classical nova models and compare the predicted isotopic ratios with those of the grains. The comparison points toward massive ONe novae if the ejecta are mixed with material of close-to-solar composition.},

Their isotopic ratios, together with those of 28 previously analyzed A+B grains, are reported here. The 14N/15N ratios range from 39 to 104, with one-third of the grains having 14N/15N ratios lower than the solar value of 272. Inferred 26Al/27Al ratios of A+B grains range up to 10-2. These isotopic compositions clearly distinguish A+B grains from other presolar SiC populations. Among the A+B grains, grains with lower 12C/13C ratios tend to have lower 14N/15N and higher 26Al/27Al ratios. Silicon of A+B grains is enriched in the neutron-rich isotopes (29Si/28Si up to 1.20 times solar, 30Si/28Si up to 1.13 times solar), and in an Si three-isotope plot the distribution of the isotopic ratios is very similar to that of mainstream grains, indicating that the parent stars of the A+B grains had close-to-solar metallicity. Titanium isotopic ratios of 13 grains, out of 30 analyzed, deviate from solar by more than 2 {$\sigma$} in at least one isotopic ratio and span the same range as those of mainstream grains. Trace element abundance patterns of 20 previously measured A+B grains indicate that seven condensed from an atmosphere without s-process enrichments, while 13 did so from an atmosphere enriched in s-process elements by 3-5 times solar. Observationally, the most likely sources of A+B grains with solar s-process abundances are J-type carbon stars, but the origin of these stars is unclear. Born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, typified by Sakurai's object (V4334 Sgr), are possible sources of A+B grains with enhanced s-process elemental abundances. Other C-rich stars with low 12C/13C ratios including R stars and CH stars are less likely stellar sources. Whatever the stellar sources, both H and He burning as well as mixing must have occurred in the proper combination to produce both low 12C/13C ratios and C {$>$} O in the envelope. A special nucleosynthetic problem is posed by the 14N/15N ratios of the grains. High ratios can be explained by hot bottom burning and by cool bottom processing in thermally pulsing AGB stars. Another proposed scenario that possibly yields this signature is extensive mixing of He-burning material into the H-rich envelope during the core He flash. However, the spread of the 14N/15N ratios and lower-than-solar 14N/15N ratios remains unexplained. The isotopic and elemental compositions of A+B grains can provide new information about nucleosynthesis in their possible parent stars that cannot be obtained in any other way.},

  abstract = {Eleven presolar silicon carbide grains of type X separated from the Murchison meteorite have been analyzed for boron abundances and isotopic compositions by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Boron concentrations are low with typical B/Si ratios of {$\approx$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-5. The average 11B/10B ratio of 3.46 {$\pm$} 1.39 is compatible with the solar system value but might be affected by contaminating boron of laboratory origin. These data are compared with theoretical predictions for Type II supernovae, the most likely parent stars of X grains. The B/Si ratios of X grains are much lower (more than an order of magnitude on average) than expected from Type II supernova shell-mixing of matter from the C- and Si-rich zones, contrary to other elemental ratios such as Al/Si and Ti/Si. Condensation calculations show that with C/O {$>$} 1 in the ejecta, boron and aluminum will readily condense as BN and AlN, respectively, into silicon carbide, and the B/Al ratio is expected to remain constant. The nitrogen, aluminum, and titanium abundances in SiC X grains are well reproduced by the condensation calculations. Given the similarity of the boron and aluminum condensation chemistry and the generally expected high B/Al ratios (relative to solar) in Type II supernova mixtures with C/O {$>$} 1, the observed difference between measured and predicted B/Al ratios must be considered a serious problem. Possible solutions include (1) lower than predicted boron production from Type II supernovae, (2) complex mixing scenarios in supernova ejecta involving only sublayers of the C-rich zones, and (3) formation of silicon carbide under conditions with C/O {$<$} 0.1.},

Ion mapping of isotopes of Si, O, and C in the ion microprobe of two size fractions (QZR4: 0.4-0.8 {$\mu$}m; QZR5: 0.8-2 {$\mu$}m) identified 55 30Si-depleted candidates out of 37,917 Si-rich grains and six 18O-depleted grains out of 54,410 oxides. Subsequent isotopic analyses of C, N, and Si of 48 grains of the 30Si-depleted candidates and additional randomly selected SiC and Si3N4 grains confirmed 36 of X-type SiC, nine of X-type Si3N4, and one of A+B-type SiC. The isotopic compositions of most X grains overlap those of previously measured X grains from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite, but 25\% show more pronounced 29Si deficits, suggestive of multiple stellar origins of X grains. Presolar Si3N4 grains have isotopic compositions similar to those of X SiC grains, except that their C isotopic ratios are close to solar. The relative abundances of various presolar grain types in Qingzhen are different from those in Murchison, suggestive of heterogeneity and/or size sorting in the primitive solar nebula.},

Isotopic data were obtained for Si and Ca-Ti (all grains), C and N (two grains), and Ti (one grain). All X grains exhibit large enrichments in 28Si (up to 5\texttimes{} solar), in agreement with previously studied X grains. On a scale of 200 nm, the Si-isotopic ratios do not vary by more than the analytical uncertainties of several percent in all but one X grain. This implies that most X grains formed from well-mixed regions in supernova ejecta. X grain M9-68-3 is characterized by two regions with distinct Si- and Ti-isotopic signatures which may either represent two distinct grains or overgrowth of matter from two different mixtures in the supernova ejecta. Most of the Ca in the X grains is most likely contamination as indicated by close to normal 42Ca/40Ca ratios. Seven X grains show enhanced 44Ca/40Ca ratios of up to 6\texttimes{} the solar ratio. Spatial distributions of 44Ca excesses and Ti are positively correlated, giving strong support to the view that excesses in 44Ca are due to the decay of radioactive 44Ti. Inferred initial 44Ti/48Ti ratios are between 0.01 and 0.28 and are correlated with Si-isotopic ratios. Radiogenic 44Ca is widely distributed in six X grains. X grain M9-132-4 exhibits a pronounced heterogeneity in the distribution of radiogenic 44Ca and 48Ti as well as in 44Ti/48Ti, pointing to presence of a small Ti-rich subgrain or heterogeneous loss of Ca and Ti after grain formation. This grain has a unique Si-isotopic composition with 30Si/29Si = 2.2\texttimes{} the solar ratio and C- and N-isotopic compositions as typically observed in X grains.},

  abstract = {We report the development of a new analytical system allowing the fully automated measurement of isotopic ratios in micrometer-sized particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in a Cameca ims-6f ion microprobe. Scanning ion images and image processing algorithms are used to locate individual particles dispersed on sample substrates. The primary ion beam is electrostatically deflected to and focused onto each particle in turn, followed by a peak-jumping isotopic measurement. Automatic measurements of terrestrial standards indicate similar analytical uncertainties to traditional manual particle analyses (e.g., {$\sim$}3\textperthousand/amu for Si isotopic ratios). We also present an initial application of the measurement system to obtain Si and C isotopic ratios for {$\sim$}3300 presolar SiC grains from the Murchison CM2 carbonaceous chondrite. Three rare presolar Si3N4 grains were also identified and analyzed. Most of the analyzed grains were extracted from the host meteorite using a new chemical dissolution procedure. The isotopic data are broadly consistent with previous observations of presolar SiC in the same size range ({$\sim$}0.5\textendash 4 {$\mu$}m). Members of the previously identified SiC AB, X, Y, and Z subgroups were identified, as was a highly unusual grain with an extreme 30Si enrichment, a modest 29Si enrichment, and isotopically light C. The stellar source responsible for this grain is likely to have been a supernova. Minor differences in isotopic distributions between the present work and prior data can be partially explained by terrestrial contamination and grain aggregation on sample mounts, though some of the differences are probably intrinsic to the samples. We use the large new SiC database to explore the relationships between three previously identified isotopic subgroups\textemdash mainstream, Y, and Z grains\textemdash all believed to originate in asymptotic giant branch stars. The isotopic data for Z grains suggest that their parent stars experienced strong CNO-cycle nucleosynthesis during the early asymptotic giant branch phase, consistent with either cool bottom processing in low-mass (M {$<$} 2.3M{$\odot$}) parent stars or hot-bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars (M {$>$} 4M{$\odot$}). The data provide evidence for a sharp threshold in metallicity, above which SiC grains form with much higher 12C/13C ratios than below. Above this threshold, the fraction of grains with relatively high 12C/13C decreases exponentially with increasing 29Si/28Si ratio. This result indicates a sharp increase in the maximum mass of SiC parent stars with decreasing metallicity, in contrast to expectations from Galactic chemical evolution theory.},

Comparison of single grain data with models of nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars indicates that the grains most likely come from low mass carbon-rich AGB stars (1.5 to 3 solar masses) of about solar metallicity and with approximately solar initial proportions of r- and s-process isotopes.

This finding, coupled with the observation of Tc spectral lines in certain stars, shows that the majority of presolar SiC grains come from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, and that the amount of 99Tc produced in such stars is insufficient to have left a detectable 99Ru anomaly in early solar system materials.}

Similarly, a large 47Ti excess in another grain argues against a nova origin.

A 350\texttimes 600nm2 Al2O3 grain has a large 17O enrichment and a slight 18O depletion, as well as a 26Mg excess due to the decay of extinct 26Al. Because of its relatively large size and prominent location within the IDP, this presolar Al2O3 grain is well characterized by SEM-EDX analyses. A second, much smaller presolar grain has a diameter of 150nm and a 13C enrichment of more than 300\%. Isotopic anomalies in C are rarely found in IDPs and the magnitude of this anomaly is unprecedented. This grain also has a 15N-rich composition and its isotopic makeup as well as its secondary ion yields identify it as a SiC grain. The discovery of presolar Al2O3 and SiC in IDPs seamlessly complements earlier notions of interplanetary dust particles as the most primitive extraterrestrial material currently available for laboratory analysis. Both Al2O3 and SiC are common presolar grain types in primitive meteorites, but they appeared conspicuously absent from the presolar grain inventory in interplanetary dust particles, which is dominated by silicate stardust. Not finding these presolar grain types in interplanetary dust would have been difficult to explain. Abundance estimates of the new presolar grain types in IDPs are hampered by limited statistics, but both Al2O3 and SiC are less common than presolar silicates which have been found at relatively high abundances in IDPs. The particle in which these presolar grains have been found belongs to the `isotopically primitive subgroup' of IDPs, yet does not contain any presolar silicates.},

Almost all analyses of presolar SiC grains since their first isolation in 1987 have been obtained from grains that were separated from their host meteorite by harsh acid dissolution. We recently reported a new method of ``gently'' separating the grains from meteorites by using freeze-thaw disaggregation, size, and density separation to retain any nonrefractory coatings or alteration to the surfaces of the grains that have been acquired in interstellar space. Nonrefractory coats or amorphized surfaces will almost certainly be removed or altered by the traditional acid separation procedure. High Li/Si and B/Si ratios of up to {$\sim$}10-2 were found implanted in the outer 0.5 {$\mu$}m of the grains dropping to {$\sim$}10-5 in the core of the grains. 7Li/6Li and 11B/10B ratios indistinguishable from solar system average values were found. Analyses obtained from SiC grains from the acid dissolution technique showed isotope ratios that were the same as those of gently separated grains, but depth profiles that were different. These results are interpreted as evidence of implantation of high velocity (1200\textendash 1800 km s-1) Li and B ions into the grains by shock waves as the grains traveled through star-forming regions some time after their condensation in the outflow of an AGB star that was their progenitor. The results are in line with spectroscopic measurements of Li and B isotope ratios in star-forming regions and may be used to infer abundances and isotopic sources in these regions.},

We also analyzed 7 SiC particles either consisting of sub-micron-size SiC grains or representing a morphologically and isotopically distinct subgroup. Of the 55 (likely) mainstream grains, originating from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, 32 had high enough Ba contents for isotopic analysis. For 26 of them, CsHx interferences were either negligible or could be corrected with confidence. They exhibit typical s-process Ba isotopic patterns with slightly higher than solar 134Ba/136Ba and lower than solar 135,137,138Ba/136Ba ratios. Results are generally well explained in the context of neutron capture nucleosynthesis in low mass (1\textendash 3 M{$\odot$}) AGB stars and provide constraints on AGB models, by reducing the needed 13C spread from factor of {$\sim$}20 down to 2. Out of the 19 supernova X grains, three had sufficient concentrations for isotopic analysis. They tend to exhibit higher than solar 134Ba/136Ba and 138Ba/136Ba ratios, close to solar 137Ba/136Ba, and 135Ba/136Ba lower than solar but higher than in mainstream grains. This signature could indicate a mixture of n-burst type Ba with either ``normal Ba'' more s-process-rich than solar, or normal Ba plus weak s-process Ba. In the n-burst component Cs may have to be separated from Ba at {$\sim$}10 years after the SN explosion. Depending on predictions for its composition, another possibility is early separation (at {$\sim$}1 year) coupled with addition of some unfractionated n-burst matter. Abundances of trace elements (Sr, Zr, Cs, La, and Ce) analyzed along with Ba signify that implantation may have been an important process for their introduction.},

With the NanoSIMS we analyzed 310 SiC grains from Murchison (carbonaceous CM2 chondrite) separate KJB (diameters 0.25\textendash 0.45{$\mu$}m) and 153 SiC grains from KJG (diameters 1.8\textendash 3.7{$\mu$}m), 154 SiC and 23 Si3N4 grains from Indarch (enstatite EH4 chondrite) separate IH6 (diameters 0.25\textendash 0.65{$\mu$}m) for their C and N isotopic compositions, 549 SiC and 142 Si3N4 grains from IH6 for their C and Si isotopic compositions, 13 SiC grains from Murchison and 66 from Indarch for their Al\textendash Mg compositions, and eight SiC grains from Murchison and 10 from Indarch for their Ti isotopic compositions. One of the original objectives of this effort was to compare isotopic analyses with the NanoSIMS with analyses previously obtained with the Cameca IMS 3f ion microprobe. Many of the Si3N4 grains from Indarch have isotopic anomalies but most of these apparently originate from adjacent SiC grains. Only one Si3N4 grain, with 13C and 14N excesses, has a likely AGB origin. The C, N, and Si isotopic data show that the percentage of SiC grains of type Y and Z increase with decreasing grain size (from {$\sim$}1\% for grains {$>$}2{$\mu$}m to {$\sim$}5\textendash 7\% for grains of 0.5{$\mu$}m), providing an opportunity for isotopic analyses in these rare grains. Our measurements expand the number of Al\textendash Mg analyses on SiC Z grains from 4 to 23 and the number of Ti analyses on Z grains from 2 to 11. Inferred26Al/27Al ratios of Z grains are in the range found in mainstream and Y grains and do not exceed those predicted by models of AGB nucleosynthesis. Cool bottom processing (CBP) has been invoked to explain the low 12C/13C ratios of Z grains, but this process apparently does not lead to increased 26Al production in the parent stars of these grains. This finding is in contrast to presolar oxide grains where CBP is needed to explain their high 26Al/27Al ratios. The low 46,47,49Ti/48Ti ratios found in Z grains and their correlation with low 29Si/28Si ratios extend the trend seen in mainstream grains and confirm an origin in low-metallicity AGB stars. The relatively large excesses in 30Si and 50Ti in Z grains are predicted by our models to be the result of increased production of these isotopes by neutron-capture nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity AGB stars. However, the predicted excesses in 50Ti (and 49Ti) are much larger than those found. Even lowering the strength of the 13C pocket cannot solve this discrepancy in a consistent way.},

  abstract = {We report the first Fe isotopic anomalies and the first Ni isotopic ratio measurements in presolar SiC grains of separate KJG from the Murchison meteorite. With NanoSIMS, we analyzed Fe and Ni in 37 X grains from Type II supernovae and 53 SiC grains of other types. The Ni/Fe and Co/Fe ratios in grains of all types are much higher than in the gas from which the grains are believed to have condensed. A majority of the X grains and a couple of mainstream grains contain Fe-rich subgrains. Most X grains have large excesses in 57Fe,61Ni, and 62Ni.60Ni excesses are small and the 54Fe/56Fe ratios of almost all X grains are normal. These isotopic compositions are best explained by mixing of material from the He/N zone of Type II supernovae with material from the He/C zone. The lack of any 54Fe excesses is puzzling in view of the fact that the Si/S zone, whose contribution resulted in the 28Si excesses in X grains, is very rich in 54Fe. It has yet to be seen whether elemental fractionation between Si and Fe is an explanation. The 57Fe deficits observed in a few X grains remain unexplained. In comparison to the X grains, fewer mainstream and AB grains have anomalies. Observed 62Ni excesses in some mainstream grains are larger than predicted for AGB stars of solar metallicity and are not accompanied by corresponding 61Ni excesses. A Y grain and a Z grain have excesses in 54Fe and 62Ni, but close to normal 57Fe/56Fe and 60,61Ni/58Ni ratios. These isotopic compositions are not expected for grains from low-metallicity AGB stars.},

The oxygen isotopic compositions of the eighteen presolar silicate (and one oxide) grains found are similar those observed previously in primitive meteorites and interplanetary dust particles, and indicate origins in oxygen-rich red giant or asymptotic giant branch stars, or in supernovae. Four grains with anomalous C isotopic compositions were also detected. 12C/13C as well as Si ratios are similar to those of mainstream SiC grains; the N isotopic composition of one grain is also consistent with a mainstream SiC classification. Presolar silicate grains were found in three of the seven AMMs studied, and are heterogeneously distributed within these micrometeorites. Fourteen of the 18 presolar silicate grains and 3 of the 4 C-anomalous grains were found within one AMM, T98G8. Presolar silicate-bearing micrometeorites contain crystalline silicates that give sharp X-ray diffractions and do not contain magnesiow\"ustite, which forms mainly through the decomposition of phyllosilicates and carbonates. The occurrence of this mineral in AMMs without presolar silicates suggests that secondary parent body processes probably determine the presence or absence of presolar silicates in Antarctic micrometeorites.},

  abstract = {Cometary material and pristine interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) best resemble the unaltered components from which our solar system was built because they have remained largely unaltered in a cold undisturbed environment since accretion in the outer protoplanetary disk. IDPs might supply more primitive assemblages for laboratory analysis than Stardust samples from comet 81P/Wild 2 but their individual provenances are typically unknown. We speculate that some IDPs collected by NASA in April 2003 may be associated with comet 26P/Grigg\textendash Skjellerup because their particularly pristine character coincides with the collection period that was predicted to show an enhanced flux of particles from this Jupiter-family comet. Some IDPs from this collection contain the most primitive assembly of interstellar matter found to date including an unusually high abundance of presolar grains and very isotopically anomalous and disordered organic matter as well as fine-grained carbonates and an amphibole associated with a GEMS-like object (glass with embedded metals and sulfides) that potentially imply formation in a nebular rather than planetary environment. The two most primitive IDPs may contain assemblages of molecular cloud material at the percent level which is supported by the presence of four rare 17O-depleted presolar silicate grains possibly of supernova(e) origin within one \textasciitilde 70{$\mu$}m2-sized IDP and the close association of a Group 1Mg-rich olivine from a low-mass red giant star with a carbonaceous nano-globule of potentially interstellar origin. Our study together with observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 during the Deep Impact experiment and 81P/Wild 2 dust analyses reveal some compositional variations and many similarities among three Jupiter-family comets. Specifically carbonates and primitive organic matter or amorphous carbon were widespread in the comet-forming regions of the outer protoplanetary disk and not all comets contain as much inner solar system material as has been inferred for comet 81P/Wild 2. The bulk and hotspot hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic anomalies as well as the carbon Raman characteristics of the organic matter in IDPs and the most primitive meteorites are remarkably similar. This implies that the same mixture of molecular cloud material had been transported inward into the meteorite-forming regions of the solar system.},

Presolar SiC abundances ({$\sim$}65 ppm) are consistent with independent estimates for CR1 and CR2 chondrites, indicating that aqueous alteration does not destroy SiC, but are significantly higher than earlier abundance estimates based on noble gas contents. Particularly notable are the high abundances ({$\sim$}120 ppm) of carbonaceous matter with anomalous C isotopic compositions that probably formed in cold molecular clouds via ion\textendash molecule reactions. The observation of both 13C-enriched and 13C-depleted compositions suggests that multiple chemical pathways contribute to the formation of this material. The abundance of such material is significantly higher in QUE 99177 and MET 00426 than in other primitive meteorites and attests to the primitive nature of the CR3 chondrites.},

Their 7Li/6Li ratios range from {$\sim$}9.3 to the solar value ({$\sim$}12). The 6Li enrichments observed in the grains can only arise from galactic cosmic ray spallation off C atoms during travel through the interstellar medium (ISM) and before incorporation into the meteorite parent body. Using appropriate production rates, we calculate recoil-loss-corrected individual exposure ages of eight grains with 6Li excesses that range from 40 Myr to about 1 Gyr. The long exposure ages ({$>$}500 Myr) are consistent with calculations of grain survival lifetimes in the ISM, while the shorter ages ({$<$}100 Myr) of two grains are more consistent with previous cosmogenic noble gas studies.

A comparison of these isotopic signatures with stellar models suggests an origin in a 15 M{$\Sun$} Type II supernova. It is possible to achieve a very good match between the 30Si/28Si, 12C/13C, and inferred 44Ti/48Ti ratios in KJB2-11-17-1 and the model predictions if matter from different supernova zones is mixed in appropriate proportions. The 29Si/28Si ratio, however, cannot be reproduced and is clearly higher than predicted. It was suggested previously by Travaglio et al. that supernova models underestimate the 29Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning regions by about a factor of 2. Because of its very high 29Si/30Si of two times the solar ratio, grain KJB2-11-17-1 provides the opportunity to make a stringent test of this hypothesis. With a twofold enhanced 29Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning zones, we find a perfect match for 29Si/28Si between the model predictions and the grain. Nuclear network calculations show that a twofold increase in the 29Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning regions requires roughly a threefold higher 26Mg({$\alpha$}, n)29Si reaction rate, the most important reaction for the production of 29Si, in the temperature range 1\textendash 3 \texttimes{} 109 K than currently used in supernova models. This increase is qualitatively within current uncertainties of this reaction rate.},

Although often too small for Si isotopic measurements, four other SiC-containing graphites show other signatures of a massive star origin. Abundance estimates suggest that such unusual SiCs are present within {$\sim$}1\% of high-density graphites. This abundance can be reconciled with the much lower abundance in the overall SiC population if these unusual SiCs are naturally smaller ({$\sim$}200 nm or less) than SiCs from other isotopic subgroups and if differential destruction of small unusual SiCs occurs in massive star outflows unless these SiCs are encapsulated in graphite.},

In a subset of these grains, we also measured N-, Mg\textendash Al-, S-, and Ca\textendash Ti-isotopic compositions as well as trace element concentrations. The overall picture emerging from the isotope data is quite comparable with that of larger grains, except for the abundances of grains from Type II supernovae (SNeII) and low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Especially, the latter are much more abundant among submicrometer-sized grains than among micrometer-sized grains. This implies that SiC grains from lower-than-solar-metallicity AGB stars are on average smaller than those from solar metallicity AGB stars which provided the majority of presolar SiC grains. We identified five grains with large enrichments in 29Si (up to 3.5\texttimes{} solar) and 30Si (up to 3.9\texttimes{} solar in three of these grains). These grains are most likely from SNeII. The isotopically light S (32S/34S of 2\texttimes{} solar) together with the heavy Si in one of these grains suggests that molecule formation precedes macroscopic mixing and dust formation in SNII ejecta. This adds to the complexity of SN mixing calculations and should be considered in future studies. In total, about 2\% of the presolar SiC grains in the size range 0.2\textendash 0.5 {$\mu$}m appear to come from SNeII. This is about a factor of 2 higher than for micrometer-sized grains and suggests that SNeII, on average, produce smaller SiC grains than solar metallicity AGB stars. The high 29Si/30Si ratio in one of the SN grains suggests that current SN models underestimate the 29Si production in the C- and Ne-burning regions by about a factor of 2. It is shown that with this adjustment the solar 29Si/28Si ratio can be well reproduced in Galactic chemical evolution models and that a merger of our Galaxy with a low-metallicity satellite some 1.5 Gyr before solar system formation could account for the slope 1.3 of the Si mainstream line.},

Similar abundances of presolar silicates ({$\sim$}152 ppm) and oxides ({$\sim$}8 ppm) were also uncovered in the primitive CR chondrite Queen Elizabeth Range (QUE) 99177, along with 13 presolar SiC grains and one presolar silicon nitride. The O-isotopic compositions of the presolar silicates and oxides indicate that most of the grains condensed in low-mass red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars. Interestingly, unlike presolar oxides, few presolar silicate grains have isotopic compositions pointing to low-metallicity, low-mass stars (Group 3). The 18O-rich (Group 4) silicates, along with the few Group 3 silicates that were identified, likely have origins in supernova outflows. This is supported by their O- and Si-isotopic compositions. Elemental compositions for 74 presolar silicate grains were determined by scanning Auger spectroscopy. Most of the grains have non-stoichiometric elemental compositions inconsistent with pyroxene or olivine, the phases commonly used to fit astronomical spectra, and have comparable Mg and Fe contents. Non-equilibrium condensation and/or secondary alteration could produce the high Fe contents. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of three silicate grains also reveals non-stoichiometric compositions, attributable to non-equilibrium or multistep condensation, and very fine scale elemental heterogeneity, possibly due to subsequent annealing. The mineralogies of presolar silicates identified in meteorites thus far seem to differ from those in interplanetary dust particles.},

The average 7Li/6Li is compatible with the solar system ratio and the lithium in the X grains is likely largely dominated by contaminating Li of laboratory or meteoritic origin. Also, most of the boron in X grains appears to be contamination but the small 11B excess of {$\sim$}16\%, significant at the 2{$\sigma$} level, can be considered a hint for the presence of boron produced by the neutrino process in the parent SNeII.

Four percent of the grains belong to Group 2, whose 18O depletions suggest cool-bottom processing in low-mass stars during the AGB phase, while 8\% are Group 4 grains with likely origins in Type II supernova (SN) ejecta. One ferromagnesian silicate has a very high 17O enrichment; nova explosions have been suggested as sources for such grains, but recent models with updated reaction rates show large discrepancies with the grain data, leaving the origins of these grains uncertain. Most of the grains are silicates (86\%) with the remainder consisting of oxides (8\%), three silica grains and two `composite' grains composed of multiple subgrains with different elemental compositions. The elemental compositions of the silicates are similar to those found in other studies, with a predominance of non-stoichiometric compositions and high (up to 44at.\%) Fe concentrations. A comparison of isotopic and elemental compositions for all presolar silicates shows that olivine compositions are overabundant in Group 4 grains compared to grains from Groups 1 and 2. This may reflect injection of presolar material from a nearby supernova into the early solar nebula and incorporation into parent bodies before alteration of compositions through irradiation and sputtering in the interstellar medium, as is likely to have occurred for the Group 1 and 2 grains from more distant AGB stars. The matrix material in ALHA77307 contains abundant carbonaceous hotspots with excesses in 15N. However, unlike CR chondrites, the insoluble organic matter (IOM) in ALHA77307 does not have a bulk N isotopic anomaly, consistent with Raman evidence that it has experienced more processing than IOM from CR chondrites. Nevertheless, secondary processing has clearly not been so pervasive as to lead to complete destruction of N isotopic anomalies in this meteorite. Moreover, presolar silicate abundances and elemental compositions show little evidence for thermal processing, indicating a decoupling of the effects of metamorphism on organic matter and matrix silicates.},

Presolar grains are rare in Kakangari and are present in reduced abundances in Adelaide (approximately 70 ppm for O-anomalous grains). Thermal annealing has led to widespread crystallization of their fine-grained matrices, and accounts for the partial to complete destruction of presolar grains. In addition, presolar silicates in Adelaide show elevated Fe abundances and Fe-rich rims indicative of infiltration of Fe into the grains from the surrounding matrix. This process probably also took place during annealing, most likely in the solar nebula, in a region with an enhanced dust-to-gas ratio. The most primitive meteorites, with the highest presolar grain abundances, appear to be those whose matrices contain abundant amorphous material that has escaped any significant thermal or aqueous alteration.},

Among these grains we identified 7 unusual or type C SiC (U/C) grains, characterized by isotopically heavy Si, and 36 supernova type X SiC grains, characterized by isotopically light Si. Selected U/C and X grains were also measured for S-, Mg\textendash Al-, and Ca\textendash Ti-isotopic compositions. We show that the U/C grains incorporated radioactive 44Ti, which is evidence that they formed in the ejecta of Type II supernova (SNII) explosions. Abundances of radioactive 26Al and 44Ti are compatible with those observed in X grains. U/C and X grains carry light S with enrichments in 32S of up to a factor of 2.7. The combination of heavy Si and light S observed in U/C grains is not consistent with abundance predictions of simple supernova models. The isotope data suggest preferential trapping of S from the innermost supernova zones, the production site of radioactive 44Ti, by the growing silicon carbide particles. A way to achieve this is by sulfur molecule chemistry in the still unmixed ejecta. This confirms model predictions of molecule formation in SNII ejecta and shows that sulfur molecule chemistry operates in the harsh and hot environments of stellar explosions.},

Thirty-one O-anomalous grains were detected: 24 were identified as silicates ({$\sim$}78 ppm); the remaining 7 are Al-rich oxides ({$\sim$}38 ppm). NWA 852 is the first C2 chondrite containing O-anomalous presolar dust in concentrations comparable to other more primitive meteorites. Eight presolar SiC grains have been found, representing the highest abundance ({$\sim$}160 ppm) observed so far in primitive meteorites. 15N-enriched matter is also present, although very heterogeneously distributed. Twenty-six of the O-anomalous grains are enriched in 17O, originating from the outflows of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We calculate a silicate/oxide abundance ratio of {$\sim$}2, which indicates a higher degree of aqueous alteration than observed for other presolar-grain-rich meteorites. NWA 852 thus stands between the presolar-grain-rich CR3 chondrites (MET 00426, QUE 99177) and CR2 chondrites with low presolar grain abundances (Renazzo, NWA 530). We calculate an initial presolar silicate abundance of {$\sim$}800 ppm for NWA 852, if silicate destruction by aqueous alteration is taken into account. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigation of one presolar Al-rich grain of an AGB star origin revealed that the grain mainly consists of a single crystal of hibonite with slightly varying orientations. A distinct subgrain (d {$<$} 100 nm) with a Ca/Ti ratio of {$\sim$}1 is located in the central region, most likely indicating a perovskite-like phase. Our data suggest this phase to be a primary condensate and not an alteration product.},

The C-, N-, and Si-isotopic compositions indicate that all 12 grains belong to the mainstream population and, as such, are interpreted to have condensed in the outflows of low-mass carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with close-to-solar metallicity. Barium isotopic analyses were carried out on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe \textendash{} Reverse Geometry (SHRIMP-RG) with combined high mass resolution and energy filtering to eliminate isobaric interferences from molecular ions. Contrary to previous measurements in small ({$<$}5{$\mu$}m) mainstream grains, the analyzed large SiC grains do not show the classical s-process enrichment, having near solar Ba isotopic compositions. While contamination with solar material is a common explanation for the lack of large isotopic anomalies in stardust SiC grains, particularly for these large grains which have low trace element abundances, our results are consistent with previous observations that Ba isotopic ratios are dependent on grain size. We have compared the SiC data with theoretical predictions of the evolution of Ba isotopic ratios in the envelopes of low-mass AGB stars with a range of stellar masses and metallicities. The Ba isotopic measurements obtained for large SiC grains from the LS+LU fractions are consistent with grain condensation in the envelope of very low-mass AGB stars (1.25M{$\odot$}) with close-to-solar metallicity, which suggests that conditions for growth of large SiC might be more favorable in very low-mass AGB stars during the early C-rich stages of AGB evolution or in stable structures around AGB stars whose evolution was cut short due to binary interaction, before the AGB envelope had already been largely enriched with the products of s-process nucleosynthesis.},

Nitrogen, Mg\textendash Al-, and Ca\textendash Ti-isotopic compositions were measured on a subset of these grains. Three grains show large 32S excesses, a signature that has been previously observed for grains from supernovae (SNe). Enrichments in 32S may be due to contributions from the Si/S zone and the result of S molecule chemistry in still unmixed SN ejecta or due to incorporation of radioactive 32Si from C-rich explosive He shell ejecta. However, a SN origin remains unlikely for the three AB grains considered here, because of missing evidence for 44Ti, relatively low 26Al/27Al ratios (a few times 10-3), and radiogenic 32S along with low 12C/13C ratios. Instead, we show that born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that have undergone a very-late thermal pulse (VLTP), known to have low 12C/13C ratios and enhanced abundances of the light s-process elements, can produce 32Si, which makes such stars attractive sources for AB grains with 32S excesses. This lends support to the proposal that at least some AB grains originate from born-again AGB stars, although uncertainties in the born-again AGB star models and possible variations of initial S-isotopic compositions in the parent stars of AB grains make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.},

A total of 35 C-anomalous grains ({$\sim$}236 ppm) and 112 O-anomalous grains ({$\sim$}189 ppm) were identified in situ using NanoSIMS ion imaging. Of 35 C-anomalous grains, 28 were determined to be SiC grains by Auger spectroscopy. Seven of the SiC grains were subsequently measured for N and Si isotopes, allowing classification as one nova grain, one Y grain, one Z grain, and four mainstream grains. Eighty-nine out of 112 O-anomalous grains belong to Group 1, indicating origins in low-to-intermediate-mass red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars. Twenty-one are Group 4 grains and have origins in supernovae. Auger spectroscopic elemental measurements of 35 O-anomalous grains show that 33 of them are ferromagnesian silicates. They have higher Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios than those reported in other meteorites, suggesting a lower degree of alteration in the nebula and/or asteroid parent bodies. Only two oxide grains were identified, with stoichiometric compositions of MgAl2O4 and SiO2, respectively. The presolar silicate/oxide ratio of GRV 021710 is comparable with those of the CR3 chondrites (QUE 99177 and MET 00426) and primitive interplanetary dust particles. In order to search for presolar sulfides, the meteorite was also mapped for S isotopes. However, no presolar sulfides were found, suggesting a maximum abundance of 2 ppm. The scarcity of presolar sulfides may be due to their much faster sputtering rate by cosmic rays compared to silicates.},

Comparison with previous data shows that acid washing is highly effective in removing barium contamination. Strong depletions in {$\delta$}(138Ba/136Ba) values are found, down to -400\textperthousand, which can only be modeled with a flatter 13C profile within the 13C pocket than is normally used. The dependence of {$\delta$}(138Ba/136Ba) predictions on the distribution of 13C within the pocket in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models allows us to probe the 13C profile within the 13C pocket and the pocket mass in AGB stars. In addition, we provide constraints on the 22Ne({$\alpha$}, n)25Mg rate in the stellar temperature regime relevant to AGB stars, based on {$\delta$}(134Ba/136Ba) values of mainstream grains. We found two nominally mainstream grains with strongly negative {$\delta$}(134Ba/136Ba) values that cannot be explained by any of the current AGB model calculations. Instead, such negative values are consistent with the intermediate neutron capture process (i process), which is activated by the very late thermal pulse during the post-AGB phase and characterized by a neutron density much higher than the s process. These two grains may have condensed around post-AGB stars. Finally, we report abundances of two p-process isotopes, 130Ba and 132Ba, in single SiC grains. These isotopes are destroyed in the s process in AGB stars. By comparing their abundances with respect to that of 135Ba, we conclude that there is no measurable decay of 135Cs (t1/2 = 2.3 Ma) to 135Ba in individual SiC grains, indicating condensation of barium, but not cesium into SiC grains before 135Cs decayed.},

One thousand one hundred thirteen SiC grains were identified based on their C and Si isotopic ratios. Mainstream, AB, C, X, Y, and Z subtypes of SiC, and X-type silicon nitride (Si3N4) account for 81.4\%, 5.7\%, 0.1\%, 1.5\%, 5.8\%, 4.9\%, and 0.4\%, respectively.

It has a huge 32S excess, larger than any seen before, and larger than that predicted for the Si/S supernova (SN) zone, providing evidence against the elemental fractionation model by Hoppe et al. Two SN models investigated here present a more satisfying explanation in terms of a radiogenic origin of 32S from the decay of short-lived 32Si ({$\tau$}1/2 = 153 yr). Silicon-32 as well as 29Si and 30Si can be produced in SNe by short neutron bursts; evidence for initial 44Ti ({$\tau$}1/2 = 60 yr) in the C grain is additional evidence for an SN origin. The X grains have marginal 32S excesses, much smaller than expected from their large 28Si excesses. Similarly, the Y and Z grains do not show the S-isotopic anomalies expected from their large Si isotopic anomalies. Low intrinsic S contents and contamination with isotopically normal S are the most likely explanations.},

Four grains with 29,30Si excesses similar to those of type C SiC grains likely came from CCSNe, which experienced explosive H burning occurred during explosions. The independent coexistence of proton- and neutron-capture isotopic signatures in these grains strongly supports heterogeneous H ingestion into the He shell in pre-supernovae. Two of the seven putative nova grains with 30Si excesses and 29Si depletions show lower-than-solar 34S/32S ratios that cannot be explained by classical nova nucleosynthetic models. We discuss these signatures within the CCSN scenario. For the remaining five putative nova grains, both nova and supernova origins are viable because explosive H burning in the two stellar sites could result in quite similar proton-capture isotopic signatures. Three of the grains are sub-type AB grains that are also 13C enriched, but have a range of higher 14N/15N. We found that 15N-enriched AB grains ({$\sim$}50 {$<$} 14N/15N {$<$} {$\sim$}100) have distinctive isotopic signatures compared to putative nova grains, such as higher 14N/15N, lower 26Al/27Al, and lack of 30Si excess, indicating weaker proton-capture nucleosynthetic environments.},

Interestingly, one AB1 grain had the largest 32S and 50Ti excesses, strongly suggesting a neutron-capture nucleosynthetic origin of the 32S excess and thus the initial presence of radiogenic 32Si (t1/2 = 153 years). More importantly, we found that the 15N and 26Al excesses of AB1 grains form a trend that extends to the region in the N\textendash Al isotope plot occupied by C2 grains, strongly indicating a common stellar origin for both AB1 and C2 grains.

Direct comparison of the data for the MS grains, which came from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with large s-process isotope enhancements, with the AB2 grain data demonstrates that AB2 grains show near-solar isotopic compositions and lack s-process enhancements. The near-normal Sr, Mo, and Ba isotopic compositions of AB2 grains clearly exclude born-again AGB stars, where the intermediate neutron-capture process (i-process) takes place, as their stellar source. On the other hand, low-mass CO novae and early R- and J-type carbon stars show 13C and 14N excesses but no s-process enhancements and are thus potential stellar sources of AB2 grains. Because both early R-type carbon stars and CO novae are rare objects, the abundant J-type carbon stars (10\%\textendash 15\% of all carbon stars) are thus likely to be a dominant source of AB2 grains.},

Our survey of a large number of presolar SiC demonstrates that (1) 80\% of core-collapse supernova and putative nova SiC can be identified by quantitative EDX and Raman analyses with {$>$}70\% confidence; (2) 90\% of presolar SiC are predominantly 3C-SiC, as indicated by their Raman transverse optical (TO) peak position and width; (3) presolar 3C-SiC with 12C/13C {$\leq$} 10 show lower Raman TO phonon frequencies compared to mainstream 3C-SiC. The downward shifted phonon frequencies of the 13C-enriched SiC with concomitant peak broadening are a natural consequence of isotope substitution. 13C-enriched SiC can therefore be identified by micro-Raman analysis; (4) larger shifts in the Raman TO peak position and width indicate deviations from the ideal 3C structure, including rare polytypes. Coordinated transmission electron microscopy analysis of one X and one mainstream SiC grain found them to be of 6H and 15R polytypes, respectively; (5) our correlated Raman and NanoSIMS study of mainstream SiC shows that high nitrogen content is a dominant factor in causing mainstream SiC Raman peak broadening without significant peak shifts; and (6) we found that the SiC condensation conditions in different stellar sites are astonishingly similar, except for X grains, which often condensed more rapidly and at higher atmospheric densities and temperatures, resulting in a higher fraction of grains with much downward shifted and broadened Raman TO peaks.},

The 25-{$\mu$}m diameter grain, termed Bonanza, was found in an acid-resistant residue of the Murchison meteorite. Grains of such large size have neither been observed around supernovae nor predicted to form in stellar environments. The large size of Bonanza has allowed the measurement of the isotopic composition of more elements in it than any other previous presolar grain, including: Li, B, C, N, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni. Bonanza exhibits large isotopic anomalies in the elements C, N, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni typical of an astrophysical origin in ejecta of a Type II core-collapse supernova and comparable to those previously observed for other presolar SiC grains of type X. Additionally, we extracted multiple focused ion beam lift-out sections from different regions of the grain. Our transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the crystalline order varies at the micrometer scale, and includes rare, higher order polytype domains (e.g., 15R). Analyses with STEM-EDS show Bonanza contains a heterogeneous distribution of subgrains with sizes ranging from {$<$}10nm to {$>$}100nm of Ti(N, C); Fe, Ni-rich grains with variable Fe:Ni; and (Al, Mg)N. Bonanza also has the highest ever inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratio, consistent with its supernova origin. This unique grain affords us the largest expanse of data, both microstructurally and isotopically, to compare with detailed calculations of nucleosynthesis and dust condensation in supernovae.},

Vandium-51 concentrations correlate with those of Ti, indicating V substitutes for Ti in the TiC matrix in many of the grains.

The observation of similar overall O-anomalous ({$\sim$}155ppm) and C-anomalous grain abundances ({$\sim$}40ppm) in all three CO3.0 chondrites suggests that they all accreted from a nebular reservoir with similar presolar grain abundances. The presence of presolar silicate grains in FGRs combined with the observation of similar estimated porosity between interstitial matrix regions and FGRs in LAP 031117 and ALHA77307, as well as the identification of a composite FGR (a small rimmed chondrule within a larger chondrule rim) in ALHA77307, all provide evidence for a formation of FGRs by accretion of dust grains onto freely-floating chondrules in the solar nebula before their aggregation into their parent body asteroids. Our study also shows systematically lower abundances of presolar silicate grains in the FGRs than in the matrix regions of CO3 chondrites, while the abundances of SiC grains are the same in all areas, within errors. This trend differs from CR2 chondrites in which the presolar silicate abundances are higher in the FGRs than in the matrix, but similar to each other within 2{$\sigma$} errors. This observation combined with the identification of localized (micrometer-scaled) aqueous alteration in a FGR of LAP 031117 suggests that the lower abundance of presolar silicates in FGRs reflects pre-accretionary aqueous alteration of the fine-grained material in the FGRs. This pre-accretionary alteration could be due to either hydration and heating of freely floating rimmed chondrules in icy regions of the solar nebula or melted water ice associated with 26Al-related heating inside precursor planetesimals, followed by aggregation of FGRs into the CO chondrite parent-body.},

  abstract = {We have conducted a NanoSIMS ion imaging survey of about 1800 presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains from the Murchison meteorite. A total of 21 supernova (SN) X grains, two SN C grains, and two putative nova grains were identified. Six particularly interesting grains, two X and C grains each and the two putative nova grains were subsequently studied in greater detail, namely, for C-, N-, Mg-Al-, Si-, S-, and Ca-Ti-isotopic compositions and for the initial presence of radioactive 26Al (half life 716,000yr), 32Si (half life 153yr), and 44Ti (half life 60yr). Their isotope data along with those of three X grains from the literature were compared with model predictions for 15M{$\odot$} and 25M{$\odot$} Type II supernovae (SNe). The best fits were found for 25M{$\odot$} SN models that consider for the He shell the temperature and density of a 15M{$\odot$} SN and ingestion of H into the He shell before the explosion. In these models a C- and Si-rich zone forms at the bottom of the He burning zone (C/Si zone). The region above the C/Si zone is termed the O/nova zone and exhibits the isotopic fingerprints of explosive H burning. Satisfactory fits of measured C-, N-, and Si-isotopic compositions and of 26Al/27Al ratios require small-scale mixing of matter originating from a region extending over 0.2M{$\odot$} for X and C grains and over 0.4M{$\odot$} for one of the putative nova grains, involving matter from a thin Si-rich layer slightly below the C/Si zone, the C/Si zone, and the O/nova zone. Simultaneous fitting of 14N/15N and 26Al/27Al requires a C-N fractionation of a factor of 50 during SiC condensation. This leads to preferential incorporation of radioactive 14C (half life 5700yr) over directly produced 14N and can account for the 14N/15N along with 26Al/27Al ratios as observed in the SiC grains. The good fit for one of the putative nova grains along with its high 26Al/27Al points towards a SN origin and supports previous suggestions that some grains classified as nova grains might be from SNe. Apparent problems with the small-scale mixing scheme considered here are C/O ratios that are mostly {$<$}1 if C-, N-, and Si-isotopic compositions and 26Al/27Al ratios are simultaneously matched, underproduction of 32Si, and overproduction of 44Ti. This confirms the limitations of one-dimensional hydrodynamical models for H ingestion and stresses the need to better study the convective-boundary mixing mechanisms at the bottom of the convective He shell in massive star progenitors. This is crucial to define the effective size of the C/Si zone formed by the SN shock. The comparison between the Si isotope data of the SN grains and the models gives a hint that the predicted 30Si is too high at the bottom of the He burning shell.},

Despite terrestrial iron and nickel contamination, significant isotopic anomalies in 54Fe/56Fe, 57Fe/56Fe, 60Ni/58Ni, 61Ni/58Ni, 62Ni/58Ni, and 64Ni/58Ni were detected in nine SN grains (of type X). Combined multi-isotope data of three grains with the largest nickel isotope anomalies ({$>$}100\textperthousand{} or {$<-$}100\textperthousand{} in at least one isotope ratio, when expressed as deviation from the solar value) are compared with the predictions of two SN models, one with and one without hydrogen ingestion in the He shell prior to SN explosion. One grain's carbon-silicon-iron-nickel isotope composition is consistent with the prediction of the model without hydrogen ingestion, whereas the other two grains' isotope anomalies could not be reproduced using either SN models. The discrepancies between the measured isotope compositions and model predictions may indicate element fractionation in the SN ejecta prior to or during grain condensation, and reiterate the need for three-dimensional SN models.},

The 49V-49Ti chronometer shows that these supernova SiC dust grains formed at least 2 years after their parent stars exploded. This result supports recent dust condensation calculations that predict a delayed formation of carbonaceous and SiC grains in supernovae. The astronomical observation of continuous buildup of dust in supernovae over several years can, therefore, be interpreted as a growing addition of C-rich dust to the dust reservoir in supernovae.}

We found that a higher percentage of AB1 grains show anomalous isotopic compositions than that of AB2 grains (14N/15N {$>$} solar), thus providing further support to the division of the two AB subgroups recently proposed by Liu et al., who showed that AB1 grains most likely originated from Type II supernovae (SNe) with explosive H burning. Comparison of the Sr, Mo, and Ba isotopic compositions of the AB1 grains with SN model predictions indicates that the s-process isotopic compositions of AB1 grains resulted from neutron-capture processes occurring during the progenitor massive stars' pre-SN evolution rather than from an explosive neutron-capture process. In addition, the observations of (1) explosive H burning occurring in the C-rich regions of the progenitor SNe of X grains as suggested by the isotopic compositions of X grains, and (2) explosive H burning occurring both at the bottom of the He/C zone and at the top of the He/N zone as suggested by model simulations, imply that explosive H burning is a common phenomenon in outer SN zones.},

Mainstream, Y and Z grains are believed to originate in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of varying metallicities, but the stellar sources of AB grains are poorly understood. We find that the 46,47,49Ti/48Ti ratios are correlated with 29Si/28Si for all of the grain types, indicating that these ratios are mainly dominated by Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). The mainstream, Y and Z grains all show enrichments in 50Ti from neutron capture nucleosynthesis. However, AGB models predict smaller excesses in 50Ti (and 49Ti) than are observed in these grains. For Z grains and especially for Y grains, the enhancement of 50Ti is greater than the enhancement in 30Si, indicating that the 13C neutron source produced a greater total fluence of neutrons than the 22Ne source in the low metallicity parent AGB stars. The Z grains plot below the mainstream correlation lines at more 48Ti- and 28Si-rich compositions in plots of 46,47,49Ti/48Ti vs. 29Si/28Si. On the other hand, the Y grains plot close to the mainstream correlation line. This could imply that the Ti isotopes evolved non-linearly at metallicities below {$\sim$}1/3 solar. The AB grains in this study have Ti isotopic compositions that fall along correlation lines defined by the mainstream grains, suggesting origins in close to solar metallicity stars. However, these grains fall below the mainstream correlation lines in plots of 46,49,50Ti/48Ti vs. 29Si/28Si and do not show enhancements in 50Ti, indicating that their parent stars did not undergo significant s-process nucleosynthesis. These data support origins of AB grains in J-type C stars rather than born-again AGB stars that undergo s-process nucleosynthesis. AB grains that do not have 50Ti excesses may provide the best measure of Si and Ti isotope GCE since their parent stars were less affected by s-process nucleosynthesis than the mainstream grains.},

It also has a matrix abundance of presolar SiC of 35 (+25/-17, 2{$\sigma$}) ppm, similar to that seen across primitive chondrite classes. This provides additional support to bulk isotopic and petrologic evidence that DOM 08006 is the most primitive known CO meteorite. Transmission electron microscopy of five presolar silicate grains revealed one to have a composite mineralogy similar to larger amoeboid olivine aggregates and consistent with equilibrium condensation, two non-stoichiometric amorphous grains, and two olivine grains, though one is identified as such solely based on its composition. We also found insoluble organic matter (IOM) to be present primarily as sub-micron inclusions with ranges of C- and N-isotopic anomalies similar to those seen in primitive CR chondrites and interplanetary dust particles. In contrast to other primitive extraterrestrial materials, H isotopic imaging showed normal and homogeneous D/H. Most likely, DOM 08006 and other CO chondrites accreted a similar complement of primitive and isotopically anomalous organic matter to that found in other chondrite classes and IDPs, but the very limited amount of thermal metamorphism experienced by DOM 08006 has caused loss of D-rich organic moieties, while not substantially affecting either the molecular carriers of C and N anomalies or most inorganic phases in the meteorite. One C-rich grain that was highly depleted in 13C and 15N was identified; we propose it originated in the Sun's parental molecular cloud.},

  abstract = {Aside from recording stellar nucleosynthesis, a few elements in presolar grains can also provide insights into the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of nuclides. We have studied the carbon, silicon, iron, and nickel isotopic compositions of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to better understand GCE. Since only the neutron-rich nuclides in these grains have been heavily influenced by the parent star, the neutron-poor nuclides serve as GCE proxies. Using CHILI, a new resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) instrument, we measured 74 presolar SiC grains for all iron and nickel isotopes. With the CHARISMA instrument, 13 presolar SiC grains were analyzed for iron isotopes. All grains were also measured by NanoSIMS for their carbon and silicon isotopic compositions. A comparison of the measured neutron-rich isotopes with models for AGB star nucleosynthesis shows that our measurements are consistent with AGB star predictions for low-mass stars between half-solar and solar metallicity. Furthermore, our measurements give an indication on the 22Ne({$\alpha$},n)25Mg reaction rate. In terms of GCE, we find that the GCE-dominated iron and nickel isotope ratios, 54Fe/56Fe and 60Ni/58Ni, correlate with their GCE-dominated counterpart in silicon, 29Si/28Si. The measured GCE trends include the Solar System composition, showing that the Solar System is not a special case. However, as seen in silicon and titanium, many presolar SiC grains are more evolved for iron and nickel than the Solar System. This confirms prior findings and agrees with observations of large stellar samples that a simple age-metallicity relationship for GCE cannot explain the composition of the solar neighborhood.},

  abstract = {We report high-resolution C, N, Al, Si, and S isotope data of 38 presolar SiC grains of type AB. Seventeen of these grains are of subtype AB1 (14N/15N {$<$} 440 = solar) and 20 of subtype AB2 (14N/15N {$\geq$} 440), previously proposed to be mainly from supernovae (AB1) and J-type carbon stars (AB2), respectively. Our data are compatible with previously obtained isotope data of AB grains, except that 26Al/27Al ratios of AB1 grains span a narrower range. The data are compared with predictions from supernova models that consider H ingestion into the He shell during the pre-supernova phase. In these models a mixture of explosive H and He burning occurs at the bottom of the He shell during passage of the supernova shock, forming the so-called O/nova zone. Mixing matter from the O/nova zone with matter from the overlying He/C zone and the stellar envelope shows that the isotopic compositions and trends of both AB1 and AB2 grains can be matched within the model uncertainties. This demonstrates that supernovae should be considered as potential sources of AB2 grains, in addition to J-type carbon stars and born-again asymptotic giant branch stars, as previously proposed.},

Direct comparison of the Y and Z grain data with data for mainstream grains from AGB stars of close-to-solar metallicity demonstrates that the three types of grains have indistinguishable Mo isotopic compositions. We show that the Mo isotope data can be used to constrain the maximum stellar temperatures (TMAX) during thermal pulses in AGB stars. Comparison of FRUITY Torino AGB nucleosynthesis model calculations with the grain data for Mo isotopes points to an origin from low-mass ({$\sim$}1.5\textendash 3 M{$\odot$}) rather than intermediate-mass ({$>$}3\textendash{$\sim$}9 M{$\odot$}) AGB stars. Because of the low efficiency of 22Ne({$\alpha$}, n)25Mg at the low TMAX values attained in low-mass AGB stars, model calculations cannot explain the large 30Si excesses of Z grains as arising from neutron capture, so these excesses remain a puzzle at the moment.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed molybdenum isotopes, together with strontium and barium isotopes, in 18 presolar silicon carbide grains using the Chicago Instrument for Laser Ionization (CHILI), a resonance ionization mass spectrometer. All observed isotope ratios can be explained by mixtures of pure s-process matter with isotopically solar material. Grain residues were subsequently analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and sulfur isotopes, as well as a subset for 26Al\textendash 26Mg systematics using the NanoSIMS. These analyses showed that all but one grain are mainstream grains, most probably coming from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. One grain is of the AB type, for which the origin is still a matter of debate. The high precision of molybdenum isotope measurements with CHILI provides the best estimate to date for s-process molybdenum made in low-mass AGB stars. The average molybdenum isotopic abundances produced by the s-process found in the analyzed mainstream SiC grains are 0\% 92Mo, 0.73\% 94Mo, 13.30\% 95Mo, 36.34\% 96Mo, 9.78\% 97Mo, 39.42\% 98Mo, and 0.43\% 100Mo. Solar molybdenum can be explained as a combination of 45.9\% s-process, 30.6\% r-process, and 23.5\% p-process contributions. Furthermore, the observed variability in the individual grain data provides insights into the variability of conditions (neutron density, temperature, and timescale) during s-process nucleosynthesis in the grains' parent stars, as they have subtle effects on specific molybdenum isotope ratios. Finally, the results suggest that the ratio between p- and r-process molybdenum in presolar SiC from many different types of parent stars is Mop/Mor = 0.767, the value inferred for the solar system and consistent with what has been found in bulk samples and leachates of primitive meteorites.},

We identified 10 presolar SiC grains, 2 likely presolar graphite grains, and 20 presolar silicate and/or oxide grains in NWA 5958. We suggest a slight modification of the commonly used classification system for presolar oxides and silicates that better reflects the grains' likely stellar origins. The matrix-normalized presolar SiC abundance in NWA 5958 is ppm (2{$\sigma$}) similar to that seen in many classes of unmetamorphosed chondrites. In contrast, the matrix-normalized abundance of presolar O-rich phases (silicates and oxides) is ppm (2{$\sigma$}), much lower than seen in interplanetary dust particles and the least-altered CR, CO, and ungrouped C chondrites, but close to that reported for CM chondrites. NanoSIMS mapping also revealed an unusual 13C-enriched ({$\delta$}13C{$\approx$}100\textendash 200\textperthousand ) carbonaceous rim surrounding a 1.4 {$\mu$}m diameter phyllosilicate grain. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of two presolar grains with a likely origin in asymptotic giant branch stars identified one as enstatite and one as Al-Mg spinel with minor Cr. The enstatite grain amorphized rapidly under the electron beam, suggesting partial hydration. TEM data of NWA 5958 matrix confirm that it has experienced aqueous alteration and support the suggestion of Jacquet et al. (34) that this meteorite has affinities to CM2 chondrites.},

The MS and Y grain data demonstrate that (1) C and N contamination mainly appears as surface contamination, and sufficient presputtering is needed to expose a clean grain surface for obtaining intrinsic C and N signals, and (2) Mg and Al contamination appears as adjacent grains and rims, and high-resolution imaging and the choice of small regions of interest during data reduction together are effective in suppressing the contamination. Our results strongly indicate that previous studies of presolar SiC grains could have sampled differing degrees of contamination for C, N, Mg, and Al. Compared to the literature data, our new MS and Y grains are in better agreement with carbon star observations for both the C and N isotopic ratios. By comparing our new, tighter distributions of 12C/13C, 14N/15N, and initial 26Al/27Al ratios for MS and Y grains with FRUITY low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar models, we provide more stringent constraints on the occurrence of cool bottom processing and the production of 26Al in N-type carbon stars, which are classical AGB stars.},

For A12236, 18 presolar silicates and 6 SiCs indicate abundances of 58 (+18/-12) and 20 (+12/-8) ppm, respectively. The SiC abundances are in the typical range of primitive chondrites. The abundance of presolar O-rich grains in A12169 is essentially identical to that in CO3.0 Dominion Range 08006, higher than in any other chondrites, while in A12236, it is higher than found in other CMs. These abundances provide further strong support that A12169 and A12236 are the least-altered CMs as indicated by petrographic investigations. The similar abundances, isotopic distributions, silicate/oxide ratios, and grain sizes of the presolar O-rich grains found here to those of presolar grains in highly primitive CO, CR, and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) indicate that the CM parent body(ies) accreted a similar population of presolar oxides and silicates in their matrices to those accreted by the parent bodies of the other CC groups. The lower abundances and larger grain sizes seen in some other CMs are thus most likely a result of parent-body alteration and not heterogeneity in nebular precursors. Presolar silicates are unlikely to be present in high abundances in returned samples from asteroids Ryugu and Bennu since remote-sensing data indicate that they have experienced substantial aqueous alteration.},

We report the detection of all major presolar grain types with O- and C-anomalous isotopic compositions typically identified in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites: 1 silicate, 1 oxide, 1 O-anomalous supernova grain of ambiguous phase, 38 SiC, and 16 carbonaceous grains. At least two of the carbonaceous grains are presolar graphites, whereas several grains with moderate C isotopic anomalies are probably organics. The presolar silicate was located in a clast with a less altered lithology than the typical extensively aqueously altered Ryugu matrix. The matrix-normalized presolar grain abundances in Ryugu are ppm for O-anomalous grains, ppm for SiC grains, and ppm for carbonaceous grains. Ryugu is isotopically and petrologically similar to carbonaceous Ivuna-type (CI) chondrites. To compare the in situ presolar grain abundances of Ryugu with CI chondrites, we also mapped Ivuna and Orgueil samples and found a total of 15 SiC grains and 6 carbonaceous grains. No O-anomalous grains were detected. The matrix-normalized presolar grain abundances in the CI chondrites are similar to those in Ryugu: ppm SiC and ppm carbonaceous grains. Thus, our results provide further evidence in support of the Ryugu\textendash CI connection. They also reveal intriguing hints of small-scale heterogeneities in the Ryugu samples, such as locally distinct degrees of alteration that allowed the preservation of delicate presolar material.},

Their abundances and compositions have been systematically studied in carbonaceous chondrites but rarely in situ in other major chondrite classes. We have conducted a NanoSIMS isotopic search for presolar grains with O- and C-anomalous isotopic compositions in the matrices of the unequilibrated ordinary chondrites Semarkona (LL3.00), Meteorite Hills 00526 (L/LL3.05), and Northwest Africa 8276 (L3.00). The matrices of even the most primitive ordinary chondrites have been aqueously altered and/or thermally metamorphosed, destroying their presolar grain populations to varying extents. In addition to randomly placed isotope maps, we specifically targeted recently reported, relatively pristine Semarkona matrix areas to better explore the original inventory of presolar grains in this meteorite. In all samples, we found a total of 122 O-anomalous grains (silicates~+~oxides), 79 SiC grains, and 22 C-anomalous carbonaceous grains (organics, graphites). Average matrix-normalized abundances with 1{$\sigma$} uncertainties are 151-46+50 ppm O-anomalous grains, 53-12+14 ppm SiC grains and 56-14+19 ppm carbonaceous grains in Semarkona, 55-10+11 ppm (O-anom.), 22-4+5 ppm (SiC) and 3-1+2 ppm (carb.) in MET 00526 and 12-3+6 ppm (O-anom.), 15-5+7 ppm (SiC) and 1-1+3 ppm (carb.) in NWA 8276. In relatively pristine ordinary chondrites and in primitive carbonaceous and C-ungrouped chondrites, the O and C isotopic composition of presolar grains and their matrix-normalized abundances are similar, despite the likely differences in chondrite-formation time and nebular location. These results suggest a relatively homogenous distribution of presolar dust across major chondrite-forming reservoirs in the solar nebula. Secondary asteroidal processes are mainly responsible for differences in presolar grain abundances between and within chondrites, highlighting the need to identify and target the most pristine chondrite matrices for such studies.},

Their C, N, and Si isotopic compositions are fully compatible with previously studied X grains. Magnesium is essentially monoisotopic 26Mg which gives clear evidence for the decay of radioactive 26Al. Inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratios are between 0.6 and 0.78 which is at the upper end of previously observed ratios of X grains. Contamination with terrestrial or solar system Al apparently is low or absent, which makes the X grains from this study particularly interesting and useful for a quantitative comparison of Al isotope data with predictions from supernova models. The consistently high 26Al/27Al ratios observed here may suggest that the lower 26Al/27Al ratios of many X grains from the literature are the result of significant Al contamination and in part also of an improper quantification of 26Al. The real dispersion of 26Al/27Al ratios in X grains needs to be explored by future studies. The high observed 26Al/27Al ratios in this work provide a crucial constraint for the production of 26Al in CCSN models. We explored different CCSN models, including both ``classical'' and H ingestion CCSN models. It is found that the classical models cannot account for the high 26Al/27Al ratios observed here; in contrast, H ingestion models are able to reproduce the 26Al/27Al ratios along with C, N, and Si isotopic ratios reasonably well.},
