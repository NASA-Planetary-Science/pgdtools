## Welcome!

The goal of this package is to provide a set of tools to
easily access and interface with the presolar grain database.
This package allows users to manage which database(s) they want to use
and provides a set of tools to filter and access the data itself.
Furthermore, maintainer tools are provided as well
in order for database maintainers to keep the package up to date.
