# PGDTools

In here is the main class `PresolarGrains`.
You can either load this class either by importing and defining it:

```python
from pgdtools import PresolarGrains
pgd = PresolarGrains()
```

or by importing the `pgd` command directly:

```python
from pgdtools import pgd
```

Most functionality is available through the available [subtools](subtools.md).
